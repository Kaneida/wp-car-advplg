Digital Designs Network Ltd. Advanced Vehicle Rental System WordPress Plugin

This development program aims to incorporate a "Vehicle Allocation Chart" into an existing car rental system plugin to be used with WordPress.

The VAC (vehicle allocation chart) has a number of functions and synchronizes with the booking list of the plugin. It mainly gives you a birds eye view of the fleets availability and allows staff to manually add remove or change bookings in real time.
