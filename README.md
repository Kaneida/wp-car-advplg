SelfDrive WP Plugin
=============

Advanced Vehicle Rental System WordPress Plugin by Digital Designs Network Ltd.

This development program aims to incorporate a "Vehicle Allocation Chart" into an existing car rental system plugin to be used with WordPress.

The VAC (vehicle allocation chart) has a number of functions and synchronizes with the booking list of the plugin. It mainly gives you a birds eye view of the fleets availability and allows staff to manually add, remove or change bookings in real time.

Screen will be split in two areas, on the left there will be vehicle details whilst on the right there will be details of bookings.

On the bookings section vertical bars will represent days of the week and the horizontal bars will represent bookings with separate colours to represent the status of the booking (a key at the bottom left will clarify statuses and colours).

Hovering over a booking will give you "at a glance" functionality with all the information displayed thereof.

At the top of the chart there will be scroll and zoom buttons to allow you to choose what and how many days to show on the screen.
